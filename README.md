 ### Learn
>- [x] Build forms and sections
>- [x] Create navigation views and navigation bar titles 
>- [x] Store program state with the @State and @FocusState property wrappers 
>- [x] Sreate user interface controls like TextField and Picker
>- [x] Create views in a loop using ForEach.
### Challenge
>- [x] Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”
>- [x] Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
>- [x] Change the tip percentage picker to show a new screen rather than using a segmented control, and give it a wider range of options – everything from 0% to 100%. Tip: use the range 0..<101 for your range rather than a fixed array.
